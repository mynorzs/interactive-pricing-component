## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned more about flexbox and the order of elements, but most importantly I learned a lot about sliders and checkboxes. There is still too much pending on that area, but I'm happy that I'm improving and discovering new things. 

Another important lesson was creativity, since there is no full support for the progress bar fill on all browsers, I had to be creative and use Javascript to achieve it.

### Continued development

I really need to focus on building a complete mental library of resources and elements, their attributes and variables that can help me build projects more efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - This helped me making the toggle switch.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/create-custom-range-input-consistent-browsers/) - This was a huge help when building the slider.
- [Example resource 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0QjqmaRtQ&ab_channel=EasyTutorials) - This is a good idea for sliders, but I couldn't just rebuild the slider, so I partially took the knowledge given and applied it my way.
